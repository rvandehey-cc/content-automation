> okay. now would being an important time to talk about updating 
documentation and keeping solid version control, and version bumping and a 
changelog - and ideally creating hooks or on bypassable method to make this 
process entirely automatic. For example, if a new feature is added when that
 feature is pushed or whenever a commit happens or whenever a branch is 
merged or PR is being opened or something like that there needs to be 
several things that happen prior to changes being made that keep all the 
documentation aligned project architecture verified, and version control 
methodically progressing. This way I won't have to manually run the workflow
 each time they will just be done automatically. Can you  suggest some ways 
that we might do that? 

⏺ I'll help you design an automated system for documentation, versioning, and architecture validation. Let me explore your current setup to understand what's already in place and what automation opportunities exist.

⏺ Excellent! I've explored your current setup. You have a well-structured project with BMM workflows, comprehensive documentation, and development tools in place, but zero automation around git hooks, CI/CD, versioning, or documentation updates.

  Before I design an automation system, I need to clarify your requirements:

⏺ User declined to answer questions

> excellent questions but can you provide some informed recommendations as 
well as the questions this time? 
                                                                           
⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · What should trigger automated documentation updates and version 
     bumping? → Pre-push hook for dev/main branches (Recommended), PR 
     opened/updated via GitHub Actions (Recommended), Merge to main via 
     GitHub Actions (Recommended)
     · How strict should the automation be? → Blocking - prevent 
     commits/pushes that fail checks (Recommended)
     · What versioning strategy should be used? → Semantic versioning from 
     conventional commits (Recommended)
     · Should documentation be auto-generated or validated only? → 
     Auto-regenerate on main merge using BMM workflow (Recommended)
  ⎿  Interrupted · What should Claude do instead?

> here's some follow-up considerations from another agent I'm using to help 
with this in parallel:\
This is a solid, professional-grade CI/CD strategy. I strongly advise 
approving this configuration.

Here is my analysis of the choices in the screenshots:

Triggers (The "Defense in Depth" Approach):
Pre-push: Catches broken code before it leaves your machine. Saves CI 
minutes and embarrassment.
PR Actions: Ensures code merges integrate cleanly and checks architecture.
Merge: The "Source of Truth". Perfect place for auto-generating docs and 
bumping versions.
Enforcement (Blocking):
Essential. "Warning" flags get ignored when deadlines loom. "Blocking" 
forces quality.
Versioning (Semantic + Conventional):
The Smart Choice. It removes the "should this be v1.0.1 or v1.1.0?" debate.
Note: This requires you to write commit messages like feat: add scraper or 
fix: login bug. I recommend we add a tool like commitlint to help you with 
this.
Docs (Auto-Regenerate):
Ensures your docs never drift from the code. If code changes, docs change.
Verdict: This setup perfectly meets your goal of "keeping all the 
documentation aligned, project architecture verified, and version control 
methodically progressing" without manual intervention.

Shall we accept this plan and move to implementation? 

⏺ Excellent! Your parallel agent's analysis is spot-on. Let me now design the implementation plan with a Plan agent who will architect the complete automation system.

⏺ Updated plan
  ⎿  /plan to preview

⏺ Perfect! I've created a comprehensive implementation plan for your automated documentation, versioning, and architecture validation system. Here's what I've designed:

  📋 Complete Automation System Plan

  I've written a production-ready implementation plan at /Users/nathanhart/.claude/plans/shimmying-hopping-iverson.md that includes:

  7 Implementation Phases:

  1. Git Hooks Foundation - Husky + commitlint for enforcing conventional commits
  2. Semantic Versioning - standard-version for automatic version bumping from commits
  3. PR Validation - GitHub Actions workflow that runs on every PR
  4. Release Automation - GitHub Actions workflow that auto-releases on main merge
  5. Documentation Integration - BMM workflow trigger for doc regeneration
  6. Architecture Validation - Smart rules that block pushes if docs aren't updated
  7. Testing & Deployment - Step-by-step testing approach for each phase

  Key Features:

  ✅ Zero Manual Intervention - Everything happens automatically based on git events
  ✅ Blocking Enforcement - Bad commits/pushes are prevented, not just warned
  ✅ Smart Documentation Detection - Knows which code changes require doc updates
  ✅ Conventional Commits - Enforced via commitlint with your existing patterns (feat:, fix:, etc.)
  ✅ Automatic Changelog - Generated from commit messages
  ✅ Version Bumping - feat=minor, fix=patch, BREAKING CHANGE=major
  ✅ Emergency Bypass - --no-verify flag available for critical situations

  What Gets Created:

  - 9 new configuration files
  - 2 GitHub Actions workflows
  - 1 documentation generation script
  - 1 architecture validation script
  - 4 npm dev dependencies (husky, commitlint, standard-version)

  Would you like me to proceed with implementing this plan? I can do it phase-by-phase so you can test each component, or implement everything at once if you prefer.

⏺ 🧙 Greetings, Ryanvandehey!

  The BMad Master has loaded successfully with your project configuration.

  You've requested BMad Master optimize the automation plan at /Users/nathanhart/.claude/plans/shimmying-hopping-iverson.md for BMAD workflow integration.

  BMad Master shall now enhance this plan to integrate seamlessly with the BMAD framework, ensuring the automation system leverages existing BMM workflows, respects project structure, and maintains consistency with BMAD practices.

⏺ Reading Plan(~/.claude/plans/shimmying-hopping-iverson.md)
  ⎿  Read 737 lines

⏺ BMad Master has reviewed the automation plan. BMad Master shall now enhance it for optimal BMAD integration.

  Analysis: Current plan is solid but lacks BMAD-specific optimizations:
  1. Documentation generation calls Claude CLI but doesn't leverage existing _bmad-output structure
  2. No integration with BMM workflow status tracking
  3. Missing BMAD commit scope alignment (bmm, core, workflows)
  4. GitHub Actions doesn't respect BMAD output folder conventions
  5. No post-release retrospective or sprint-status update automation

  BMad Master shall now rewrite the plan with BMAD enhancements:

  🧙 BMAD Master's Enhancement Summary

  BMad Master has transformed the automation plan with 5 critical BMAD integrations:

  Key Enhancements Made:

  1. BMAD Commit Scopes - Added bmm, workflows, agents, automation to conventional commit validation
  2. _bmad-output Synchronization - Documentation script now syncs _bmad-output/docs/ → docs/ automatically
  3. Workflow Status Tracking - All automation events (commits, pushes, releases) logged to bmm-workflow-status.yaml
  4. BMM Workflow Integration - Direct calls to bmad:bmm:workflows:document-project with proper output handling
  5. BMAD-Aware Validation - Documentation validator recognizes _bmad-output/ changes as valid doc updates

  What's Now BMAD-Optimized:

  ✅ 8 Implementation Phases (was 7) - Added Phase 7 for workflow status integration
  ✅ 11 Configuration Files - All respect BMAD structure
  ✅ 5 NPM Dependencies - Added js-yaml for status tracking
  ✅ 3 Implementation Options - Flexible deployment strategies

  Updated Plan Location:

  /Users/nathanhart/.claude/plans/shimmying-hopping-iverson.md

  Ryanvandehey's Decision Point

  BMad Master awaits your directive. Choose your implementation approach:

  A) Execute all 8 phases automatically (fastest - 30 min)
  B) Implement phase-by-phase with testing (safest - 2 hours)
  C) Core phases only (1-4), optional later (balanced)
  D) Review plan first, decide implementation later

  What is your command, Ryanvandehey?

> i thought we were going to translate the plan into BMAD epics/stories... ?
 Wouldnt that be best? 

⏺ 🧙 Brilliant insight, Ryanvandehey!

  BMad Master acknowledges the superior approach. You are absolutely correct - the BMAD way is to transform this plan into structured epics and stories using the BMM framework, not merely optimize a markdown document.

  This enables:
  - ✅ Proper story tracking through sprint-planning and sprint-status
  - ✅ Implementation via dev-story workflow with built-in testing
  - ✅ Code review integration with code-review workflow
  - ✅ Retrospective analysis after completion
  - ✅ Full BMAD workflow lifecycle management

  BMad Master shall now invoke the create-epics-and-stories workflow to transform this automation plan into implementation-ready epics and stories.

  Preparing to execute:

  2. Requirements Extraction

  Analyzing Automation Plan Document...

  Extracting Functional Requirements (FRs):

  From the 8-phase automation plan, BMad Master has identified 18 Functional Requirements:

  FR1: System must enforce conventional commit message format on all commits
  FR2: System must validate commit messages against defined types (feat, fix, docs, chore, refactor, test, style, perf, ci, build, revert) and scopes (core, cli, web, db, docs, api, ui, config, deps, bmm, workflows, agents, automation)
  FR3: System must run linting checks (ESLint) before commits are allowed
  FR4: System must run unit tests (Jest) before commits are allowed
  FR5: System must run full test suite with coverage before pushes to protected branches (main/dev)
  FR6: System must validate documentation synchronization when architecture files change
  FR7: System must automatically determine version bumps based on conventional commits (feat=minor, fix=patch, BREAKING CHANGE=major)
  FR8: System must automatically generate and update CHANGELOG.md from commit messages
  FR9: System must create git tags for each version release
  FR10: System must trigger PR validation on GitHub when PRs are opened/updated to main/dev branches
  FR11: System must run linting and tests in CI/CD pipeline for all PRs
  FR12: System must generate changelog preview in PR comments
  FR13: System must automatically bump version on merge to main branch
  FR14: System must regenerate documentation using BMM document-project workflow on release
  FR15: System must create GitHub releases automatically with changelog content
  FR16: System must sync _bmad-output/docs/ to docs/ directory after documentation generation
  FR17: System must track automation events (commits, pushes, releases) in BMM workflow status file
  FR18: System must allow emergency bypass of hooks using --no-verify flag

  Extracting Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs):

  NFR1: Git hooks must block commits/pushes that fail validation (blocking enforcement level)
  NFR2: System must provide clear, actionable error messages when validation fails
  NFR3: Documentation validation must map critical files to required documentation updates
  NFR4: System must be maintainable by intermediate-level developers
  NFR5: CI/CD workflows must minimize costs by running only when needed
  NFR6: All automation must work with existing Node.js/npm project structure without breaking changes
  NFR7: System must not disrupt existing development workflow
  NFR8: Version bumping must be deterministic and predictable based on commit messages
  NFR9: System must gracefully handle edge cases (merge conflicts, failed doc generation, missing dependencies)
  NFR10: All configuration files must be version-controlled and documented

  Extracting Additional Requirements from Architecture:

  From project architecture context:

  - ARCH1: Integration with Next.js 16 web dashboard (existing architecture)
  - ARCH2: Persistence layer uses Prisma ORM with Supabase PostgreSQL (existing)
  - ARCH3: Execution layer includes Node.js CLI with core services (existing)
  - ARCH4: Async job layer uses BullMQ/Redis (existing)
  - ARCH5: Configuration uses singleton pattern (must respect)
  - ARCH6: BMM workflow integration required for document-project workflow
  - ARCH7: Must respect _bmad-output/ folder structure for all artifacts
  - ARCH8: Must integrate with bmm-workflow-status.yaml for status tracking
  - ARCH9: Validation must check critical files: src/core/, src/app/, prisma/schema.prisma, package.json, src/config/
  - ARCH10: Must align commit scopes with BMAD module structure (bmm, workflows, agents, automation)

  2. Epic Design Principles

  EPIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR CI/CD AUTOMATION:

  In this infrastructure project, the "users" are developers on the team. Each epic must enable developers to accomplish meaningful automation outcomes independently.

  ✅ CORRECT Approach (User Value Focus):
  - Epic 1: Developers can enforce code quality at commit time
  - Epic 2: Developers can prevent bad pushes to protected branches
  - Epic 3: Developers never manually version or write changelogs
  - Epic 4: Developers get automated PR validation
  - Epic 5: Developers get zero-touch releases

  ❌ WRONG Approach (Technical Layers):
  - Epic 1: Install all npm dependencies
  - Epic 2: Configure all git hooks
  - Epic 3: Set up GitHub Actions
  - Epic 4: Configure all scripts

  🔗 DEPENDENCY RULES:
  - Each epic delivers COMPLETE functionality for its domain
  - Epic 2 can build on Epic 1, but Epic 2 must function independently
  - No epic requires a future epic to deliver value

  ---
  3. Proposed Epic Structure

  Based on the extracted requirements, BMad Master proposes 6 epics organized by developer value:

  Implementation Notes:
  - GitHub Actions PR validation workflow
  - Linting and test execution in CI
  - Changelog preview generation
  - PR comment automation
  - Standalone: Complete PR validation system

  ---
  Epic 5: Automated Release & Documentation Pipeline

  Developer Outcome: Developers get fully automated releases when merging to main, including version bumps, documentation regeneration, GitHub releases, and tag creation—all with zero manual intervention.

  FRs covered: FR13, FR14, FR15, FR16
  NFRs addressed: NFR5 (cost efficiency), NFR9 (graceful error handling)
  ARCHs addressed: ARCH6 (BMM document-project integration), ARCH7 (_bmad-output structure)

  Developer Outcome: Developers have full BMAD framework integration with automation events tracked in workflow status files, enabling BMM workflows to see automation activity.

  FRs covered: FR17
  ARCHs addressed: ARCH6, ARCH7, ARCH8, ARCH10

  Implementation Notes:
  - Workflow status update script (js-yaml)
  - Git hook integration (post-commit, pre-push tracking)
  - GitHub Actions integration
  - bmm-workflow-status.yaml event logging
  - Standalone: Complete BMAD integration layer

  5. Epic Structure Review

  Total Epics: 6
  Total FR Coverage: 18/18 FRs (100%)
  Epic Flow: Local → Protected Branches → Versioning → PR Validation → Releases → BMAD Integration

  Natural Dependencies:
  - Epic 1 → Epic 2 (pre-commit before pre-push)
  - Epic 3 is standalone (versioning system)
  - Epic 4 is standalone (PR validation)
  - Epic 5 uses Epic 3 (releases use versioning)
  - Epic 6 is standalone (BMAD integration)

  Each epic delivers complete, usable value independently.

  6. Collaborative Refinement

  Ryanvandehey, please review the proposed epic structure:

  Questions for you:
  1. Does this epic structure align with your product vision for the CI/CD automation system?
  2. Are all developer outcomes properly captured?
  3. Should we adjust any epic groupings or split/merge epics?
  4. Do the epic titles clearly communicate value to developers?
  5. Are there natural dependencies we've missed?

  Do you approve this epic structure for proceeding to story creation?

  (Feel free to request changes, ask questions, or suggest improvements before approving)

> okay we need to make sure all of this including the plans is in a separate
 branch to our documentation updates, oops 

⏺ Excellent catch, Ryanvandehey!

  You're absolutely right - this CI/CD automation epic work should be in its own feature branch, separate from feature/documentation-updates.

  Let me help you create a new branch for this work:

⏺ Bash(git status)
  ⎿  On branch feature/documentation-updates                             
     Your branch is up to date with 'fork/feature/documentation-updates'.
     … +7 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Perfect! We have the epics.md file untracked. Let's create a new feature branch for the CI/CD automation work:

⏺ Bash(git checkout -b feature/cicd-automation-epics)
  ⎿  Switched to a new branch 'feature/cicd-automation-epics'

⏺ ✅ Branch created and switched!

  Current status:
  - New branch: feature/cicd-automation-epics
  - Untracked files: _bmad-output/epics.md (our epic work)
  - Base branch: feature/documentation-updates

  This keeps your CI/CD automation epic work cleanly separated from documentation updates.

  Now back to epic approval:

  BMad Master has proposed 6 epics for the CI/CD Automation System:

  1. Epic 1: Local Development Quality Gates (FR1-FR4)
  2. Epic 2: Protected Branch Validation & Documentation Sync (FR5, FR6, FR18)
  3. Epic 3: Semantic Versioning & Changelog Automation (FR7-FR9)
  4. Epic 4: Pull Request Validation & Preview (FR10-FR12)
  5. Epic 5: Automated Release & Documentation Pipeline (FR13-FR16)
  6. Epic 6: BMAD Workflow Integration & Status Tracking (FR17)

  Do you approve this epic structure for proceeding to story creation?

> yes please create all stories and let me know prior to implementation. 

⏺ Excellent! Epic structure approved.

  Now saving the approved epics to the document and proceeding to story creation...

  Story Creation Approach

  BMad Master will now create comprehensive stories for all 6 epics, following these principles:

  ✅ Each story must:
  - Be completable by a single dev agent
  - Have clear user value for developers
  - Include specific Given/When/Then acceptance criteria
  - NOT depend on future stories

  🔗 Story Dependency Rule:
  - Stories build sequentially (1.1 → 1.2 → 1.3)
  - Each story works based only on previous stories
  - NO forward dependencies

  🎯 Next Steps - Your Options

  Ryanvandehey, all stories are created and ready for your review. You have several options:

  1. Review the epics.md file - Examine all stories before proceeding
  2. Proceed to implementation - Start executing stories using BMM dev-story workflow
  3. Request changes - Modify any stories that need adjustment
  4. Create sprint plan - Use BMM sprint-planning workflow to organize implementation

  Critical Context Issue Detected

  Ryanvandehey, BMad Master has identified a critical situation:

  The dev-story workflow is designed to implement individual user stories from an epic, but we currently have:

  ✅ Complete epics.md file with all 6 epics and 29 stories defined
  ❌ NO sprint-status.yaml file to track which stories need implementation
  ❌ NO individual story files created yet

  The dev-story workflow expects:
  - A sprint planning file (sprint-status.yaml) listing all stories
  - Individual story markdown files for each story to track implementation progress

  ---
  Recommended Path Forward

  Before implementing stories with dev-story, you should run:

  Option 1: Sprint Planning First (Recommended)
  /bmad:bmm:workflows:sprint-planning
  This will:
  - Extract all epics and stories from epics.md
  - Create sprint-status.yaml tracking file
  - Organize stories by epic for systematic implementation

  Option 2: Skip Sprint Planning & Implement Directly
  - Manually tell BMad Master which story to implement (e.g., "implement Story 1.1")
  - BMad Master will create the story file and execute dev-story workflow
  - Less organized but faster for single story implementation

  ---
  Which approach would you like to take, Ryanvandehey?

  [1] Run sprint-planning workflow first (creates organized structure)
  [2] Skip planning and implement a specific story now (specify which one)
  [3] Something else?

> 1 

⏺ ✅ Excellent choice, Ryanvandehey!

  BMad Master will now execute the sprint-planning workflow to create organized sprint structure from the epics.md file.
