# Story 1.1: Install and Configure Husky Git Hook Manager

**Status:** review

## Story
As a developer, I want Husky installed and initialized in the project, so that I can configure git hooks to run automatically on commit events.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] **Given** the project has a package.json file
- [x] **When** I install Husky as a dev dependency and run `npx husky init`
- [x] **Then** a `.husky/` directory is created in project root
- [x] **And** a `prepare` script is added to package.json that runs `husky install`
- [x] **And** Husky hooks are activated when git commands are executed
- [x] **And** the installation is documented in package.json devDependencies

## Tasks/Subtasks
- [x] Install Husky using `npx husky init`
- [x] Verify `.husky` directory creation
- [x] Verify `prepare` script in package.json
- [x] Verify devDependency in package.json
- [x] Create a dummy hook to test execution (optional, for validation)
- [x] Clean up any dummy hooks

## Dev Notes
- Follow strict Red-Green-Refactor.
- Test manually since this is infrastructure setup.
